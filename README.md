Downloader for the CCTV live streams. Can download up to 24 hours before the current time.

# Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18.16.0 or later, adding it to your PATH
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dd-pardal/spcctv-downloader/releases/latest) (first asset) and extract it to a new directory.

# Usage

1. Open a terminal with the directory you created as the working directory (`cd` into it).
2. Now you can run `node build/download-live.js`. That command will tell you how to run the program.

I'd love to elaborate on the instructions but there's no time to explain.
